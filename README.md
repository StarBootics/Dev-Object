# DevObject
Dev-Object is a kind of Computer Aided Programming or CAP tool. The equivalent I have seen in C++ is a Class Wizard tool integrated into Code::Blocks IDE that can be used to generate a header file (.h) and an implementation file (.cpp). As you know in PureBasic a single source code can do the job and this is what Dev-Object do for you.
